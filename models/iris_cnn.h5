Model Creation
A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is built for multi-class Iris flower image classification.
Architecture Details:
Input Layer: 128 × 128 RGB images
Convolution Block 1:
Conv2D with 32 filters (3×3), ReLU activation
MaxPooling (2×2)
Convolution Block 2:
Conv2D with 64 filters (3×3), ReLU activation
MaxPooling (2×2)
Convolution Block 3:
Conv2D with 128 filters (3×3), ReLU activation
MaxPooling (2×2)
Flatten Layer: Converts feature maps to 1D vector
Fully Connected Layer: Dense (128 neurons, ReLU)
Dropout: 0.5 to reduce overfitting
Output Layer: Dense (3 neurons, Softmax) for multi-class classification

Model Compilation
Optimizer: Adam
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
Evaluation Metric: Accuracy

The model is trained using augmented training data and validated using a separate validation dataset.
Epochs: Defined by EPOCHS
Validation: Real-time performance monitoring on validation data
